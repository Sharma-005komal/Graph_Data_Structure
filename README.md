# Graph_Data_Structure

1. Graph is non - linear data structure that build with the help of two components that are nodes/vertex and edges(that combines nodes).

2. Undirected graph is defined as those graph which doesn't have direction edges between vertices.

3. Directed graph is defined as those graph which have direction edges between vertices.

4. Degree of graph is defined as the number of edges of incoming and outgoing of vertices.

5. Graph can be implemented by
(i) Adjacency matrix
(ii) Adjacency list
